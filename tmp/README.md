# Agentic Agent

A CLI that gives AI agents the structure they need to ship real features — specs, context, tasks, and validation in one workflow.

---

## The Problem

AI coding agents are powerful but chaotic. Without structure, they:

- **Lose context** — agents don't know what other modules do, what was decided last session, or what constraints exist. They reinvent, contradict, and break things.
- **Sprawl across the codebase** — a "simple feature" touches 20 files across 8 directories. No human can review that. No agent should attempt it.
- **Skip validation** — agents write code but don't verify it meets requirements, follows conventions, or stays within scope.
- **Lock you into one tool** — your workflow shouldn't break when you switch from Claude Code to Cursor to Copilot.

Agentic Agent solves this by giving every AI agent the same structured workflow: specs define what to build, context keeps agents focused, tasks enforce atomic scope, and validation catches drift.

---

## How It Works

```
                         Your Project
                             |
           +-----------------+-----------------+
           |                 |                 |
       Specs             Context            Tasks
   (source of truth)  (per-directory)   (atomic units)
           |                 |                 |
           +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                    |                 |
              Claim + Build       Validate
            (readiness checks)   (scope, context)
                    |                 |
                    +--------+--------+
                             |
                     Complete + Learn
```

The core loop:

```
  track init --> brainstorm --> refine spec --> activate
       |                                          |
       |                          generate plan + decompose tasks
       |                                          |
       +--- complete <--- validate <--- claim + implement
```

Every command works with **any AI agent** — Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini, or manual development.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
go install github.com/javierbenavides/agentic-agent/cmd/agentic-agent@latest

# Initialize a project
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
agentic-agent init --name "My Project"

# Start a track with brainstorming scaffolding
agentic-agent track init "User Authentication" \
  --purpose "Secure user login" \
  --success "Users can register, login, logout"

# Brainstorm with your AI agent using the generated brainstorm.md
# Then check spec completeness
agentic-agent track refine user-authentication

# Activate: generate plan + decompose into tasks
agentic-agent track activate user-authentication --decompose

# Work on tasks
agentic-agent task claim TASK-001       # Readiness checks + claim
agentic-agent context generate internal/auth  # Context for the agent
agentic-agent validate                  # Check scope and context
agentic-agent task complete TASK-001    # Done
```

All commands support **dual mode** — run without arguments for interactive wizards, or pass flags for scripting:

```bash
agentic-agent track init                        # Interactive wizard
agentic-agent track init "Auth" --purpose "..."  # Flag mode
```

---

## Installation

**Prerequisites:** Go 1.22+, Git

```bash
# Option 1: Go install (recommended)
go install github.com/javierbenavides/agentic-agent/cmd/agentic-agent@latest

# Option 2: Build from source
git clone https://github.com/javierbenavides/agentic-agent.git
cd agentic-agent
make setup    # install + build + copy to /usr/local/bin

# Option 3: Development (no install)
go run ./cmd/agentic-agent version
```

---

## Core Concepts

### Specifications — the source of truth

Specs live in `.agentic/spec/` (or Spec Kit / OpenSpec directories). Agents reference them, never serve as the source of truth themselves.

```bash
agentic-agent task create --spec-refs "auth-requirements.md,api-design.md"
```

### Tracks — from idea to implementation

Tracks group a spec, plan, and tasks into a single work unit. The brainstorming workflow guides you from a vague idea to a well-formed spec through structured dialogue with your AI agent.

```bash
# 1. Initialize with brainstorming scaffolding
agentic-agent track init "User Auth" --type feature

# 2. Use brainstorm.md as a dialogue script with your agent
#    Agent asks one question at a time, proposes 2-3 approaches,
#    presents design in sections for validation

# 3. Check spec completeness
agentic-agent track refine user-auth
#   ✓ purpose
#   ✓ constraints
#   ✗ design (missing)

# 4. Activate: validate spec → generate plan → decompose into tasks
agentic-agent track activate user-auth --decompose
```

Track status progresses through: **ideation** → **active** → **done**. Tasks linked to ideation tracks are skipped by autopilot until the track is activated.

Templates are customizable — override the defaults by placing your own in `.agentic/templates/track/`.

### Context isolation — agents stay focused

Each directory gets a `AGENTS.md` file describing its purpose, dependencies, and constraints. The CLI bundles only the relevant context for each task, so agents don't drown in irrelevant information.

```bash
agentic-agent context generate internal/auth   # Generate context.md
agentic-agent context build --task TASK-001    # Bundle: specs + context + task
```

The context bundle sent to an agent includes:

```
Context Bundle for TASK-001
|-- Global Context (project-wide)
|-- Rolling Summary (recent changes)
|-- Task Details (title, acceptance criteria, scope)
|-- Resolved Specs (full content from spec_refs)
|-- Resolved Skills (targeted content from skill_refs, or all installed)
+-- Directory Contexts (context.md from task scope)
```

### Atomic tasks — small, reviewable units

Tasks are capped at **5 files** and **2 directories**. Larger work gets decomposed:

```bash
agentic-agent task decompose TASK-001 \
  "Create JWT service" \
  "Add auth middleware" \
  "Write integration tests"
```

### Readiness checks — verify before starting

When claiming a task, the CLI checks that inputs exist, specs resolve, and scope directories are present:

```
$ agentic-agent task claim TASK-001

Task TASK-001: READY
  [+] spec-resolvable: "auth-requirements.md" resolved at .agentic/spec/auth-requirements.md
  [+] spec-completeness: all 2 specs found
  [+] inputs-exist: all input files present
  [!] scope-dir: "internal/auth" does not exist (warning)
Claimed task TASK-001
```

If specs are missing, the CLI provides agent-guiding recommendations:

```
$ agentic-agent task claim TASK-123

Task TASK-123: READY (with warnings)
  [+] input-exists: input file "None" valid (no inputs required)
  [-] spec-completeness: 2 specs missing: todo-app/proposal.md, todo-app/tasks/01-setup.md

⚠️  MISSING SPECS DETECTED

The following spec files are referenced but don't exist:
  - todo-app/proposal.md
  - todo-app/tasks/01-setup.md

📋 RECOMMENDED ACTIONS FOR AGENTS:

  Option 1: Auto-generate specs (recommended)
  → agentic-agent spec generate TASK-123 --auto

  Option 2: Generate with user interaction
  → agentic-agent spec generate TASK-123 --interactive

  Option 3: Create specs manually
  → agentic-agent spec create todo-app/proposal.md
  → agentic-agent spec create todo-app/tasks/01-setup.md

  Option 4: Skip validation and proceed
  → agentic-agent task claim TASK-123 --skip-validation

💡 CONTEXT: This task was likely created outside the recommended workflow.
   For best results, follow: brainstorming → product-wizard → openspec init

🤖 AGENT TIP: Read the user's intent. If they want to proceed quickly,
   use --skip-validation. If quality matters, use --auto generation.
```

### Agent-agnostic — works with everything

The same project structure works across Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini, Windsurf, Antigravity IDE, and Codex. Generate tool-specific configs or install skill packs:

```bash
agentic-agent skills generate-claude-skills
agentic-agent skills generate-gemini-skills

# Install skill packs for one or more tools
agentic-agent skills install tdd --tool claude-code
agentic-agent skills install tdd --tool claude-code,cursor,gemini
agentic-agent skills list
```

### Skill packs — reusable agent skills

Skill packs are tool-agnostic bundles of instructions that install into the correct directory for each AI agent tool:

| Tool | Project directory |
|------|-------------------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/skills/` |
| Gemini CLI | `.gemini/skills/` |
| Windsurf | `.windsurf/skills/` |
| Antigravity | `.agent/skills/` |
| Codex | `.codex/skills/` |

```bash
# Install TDD skill pack for Claude Code (project-level)
agentic-agent skills install tdd --tool claude-code

# Install for multiple tools at once
agentic-agent skills install tdd --tool claude-code,cursor,gemini

# Install globally (user-level)
agentic-agent skills install tdd --tool claude-code --global

# Interactive mode — select pack, then multi-select tools
agentic-agent skills install

# Interactive skills menu — browse all skills subcommands
agentic-agent skills
```

### Task-level skill refs — targeted skills per task

Instead of applying all installed skill packs to every task, declare `skill_refs` on individual tasks to include only the relevant skills:

```yaml
# .agentic/tasks/backlog.yaml
tasks:
  - id: "TASK-001"
    title: "Refactor auth middleware"
    skill_refs:
      - code-simplification
      - tdd
    scope:
      - "internal/auth"
```

When a context bundle is built for this task, only the referenced skill packs are included — not all installed packs. Tasks without `skill_refs` fall back to the existing behavior (all installed packs included).

Skill refs resolve through a 3-tier fallback:

1. Agent's installed skill directory (e.g., `.claude/skills/tdd/SKILL.md`)
2. Any installed tool's skill directory
3. Embedded pack content (compiled into the binary — always available)

### Simplify command — targeted code review

The `simplify` command generates a focused context bundle for code simplification review:

```bash
# Review specific directories
agentic-agent simplify internal/auth internal/middleware

# Review directories from a task's scope
agentic-agent simplify --task TASK-001

# Output as JSON
agentic-agent simplify . --format json --output review.json
```

The bundle includes the code-simplification skill instructions, directory context, source file listings, and tech stack information.

### TDD workflow — RED/GREEN/REFACTOR

The `work --follow-tdd` flag decomposes a task into three phased sub-tasks and verifies the TDD skill pack is installed:

```bash
# Install the TDD skill pack first
agentic-agent skills install tdd --tool claude-code

# Work on a task with TDD workflow
agentic-agent work --task TASK-001 --follow-tdd
```

This creates three sub-tasks:

1. **RED** (`TASK-001-red`) — Write failing tests
2. **GREEN** (`TASK-001-green`) — Implement minimal code to pass
3. **REFACTOR** (`TASK-001-refactor`) — Improve code quality

---

## Spec-Driven Development

Configure `specDirs` to search multiple spec sources in priority order:

```yaml
# agnostic-agent.yaml
paths:
  specDirs:
    - .specify/specs       # Spec Kit
    - openspec/specs        # OpenSpec
    - .agentic/spec         # Native (fallback)
```

When a task references `auth/spec.md`, the resolver searches each directory in order and uses the first match. Specs are read fresh from disk every time — no caching, no sync.

```bash
# List all specs across configured directories
agentic-agent spec list

# Resolve and print a specific spec
agentic-agent spec resolve "auth/spec.md"
```

### Spec Validation & Auto-Generation

The system validates spec completeness and can auto-generate missing specs from context:

```bash
# Generate missing specs for a task (smart context detection)
agentic-agent spec generate TASK-123 --auto

# Generate interactively (prompts for requirements)
agentic-agent spec generate TASK-123 --interactive

# Generate from specific PRD
agentic-agent spec generate TASK-123 --from-prd path/to/prd.md

# Create spec manually with template
agentic-agent spec create todo-app/proposal.md

# Validate all tasks have complete specs
agentic-agent spec validate
```

**Smart Context Detection:** The generator automatically chooses the best source:
1. **PRD-based** — If a PRD file exists for the feature
2. **Interactive** — If running in a terminal (prompts for input)
3. **Metadata** — Fallback using task description and acceptance criteria

**Configuration:**
```yaml
# agnostic-agent.yaml
workflow:
  validate_specs_on_claim: true  # Validate before claiming tasks
  spec_validation_mode: "warn"   # "warn" | "block" | "silent"
```

See [docs/SPEC_DRIVEN_DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/SPEC_DRIVEN_DEVELOPMENT.md) for Spec Kit, OpenSpec, and native spec workflows.

### OpenSpec CLI

The `openspec` command group handles the full change lifecycle — from a requirements file to archived implementation:

```bash
# Initialize a change from requirements
agentic-agent openspec init "Auth Feature" --from .agentic/spec/auth-requirements.md

# Fill in proposal.md and tasks.md, then import into backlog
agentic-agent openspec import auth-feature

# Track progress, complete, and archive
agentic-agent openspec status auth-feature
agentic-agent openspec complete auth-feature
agentic-agent openspec archive auth-feature
```

Tell your agent: *"Start a project from requirements.md following openspec"* — the openspec skill handles the full flow automatically.

---

## Autopilot Mode

Process backlog tasks sequentially — readiness checks, claim, context generation, and bundling:

```bash
# Preview without making changes
agentic-agent autopilot start --dry-run

# Process up to 5 tasks
agentic-agent autopilot start --max-iterations 5
```

```
--- Iteration 1/5 ---
Next task: [TASK-001] Create JWT token service
Task TASK-001: READY
  [+] spec-resolvable: "auth-requirements.md" resolved
  [+] inputs-exist: all inputs present
Claimed TASK-001
Generated context for internal/auth
Built context bundle (toon format)

--- Iteration 2/5 ---
Next task: [TASK-002] Implement auth middleware
...
```

Autopilot stops when all tasks are processed, `--max-iterations` is reached, or you press Ctrl+C.

## Troubleshooting

**`agentic-agent: command not found`** — Add the binary to your PATH or use `go run ./cmd/agentic-agent`.

**Validation fails with "Missing context.md"** — Run `agentic-agent context scan` to find directories missing context, then `agentic-agent context generate <dir>`.

**Task size validation fails** — Decompose with `agentic-agent task decompose TASK-001 "Subtask 1" "Subtask 2"`.

**Task claim fails with "not found in backlog"** — Check task status with `agentic-agent task list`. Tasks can only be claimed from backlog.
